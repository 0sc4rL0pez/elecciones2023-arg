This is a public repository of a Data Science project that aims to predict the 2023 Argentine presidential elections

It is divided into five folders that correspond to each stage of the project.

It is likely that you will have to modify the paths when reading files because I did almost the entire project locally, I apologize in advance for that (I'm currently changing that)

There are more details in https://www.instagram.com/oscar_ds.py/

You alse can check the visualization app I created: https://elecciones2023-arg-etb9aog5a4vpq4ycvlh8uf.streamlit.app/

IMPORTANT: It is crucial to have basic knowledge of how elections work here in Argentina, so I recommend doing a little research

For any questions about its operation, send me an email to lopezcoroneloscarmanuel@gmail.com with the subject 'Elecciones + IA'
